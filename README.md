# ManageLeague

Manage League is a java project allowing users to creat and manage a football league such as the English Premier league for example.
The idea is that at first, the user creates, adds football teams and sets the dates for the different matches.
The next step includes encoding the results of the football matches when they have been played. The user can then view the general table of
the league see the standings of each team as the league progresses.
