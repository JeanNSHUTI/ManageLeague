## Intro

Manage League is a java project allowing users to create and manage a football league such as the English Premier league for example.
The idea is that at first, the user creates, adds football teams and sets the dates for the different matches.
The next step includes encoding the results of the football matches when they have been played. The user can then view the general table of
the league see the standings of each team as the league progresses.

When launching the code for the first time (AKA there is no existing League object in
memory) the user will be asked to create a league and all the teams that will be participating.
Once that is done the user will be brought straight to a menu whenever running the code.
Everything was planned to be done in command line and the number of teams participating is planned
to stay unlimited.

## Additional Points

*Could maybe be used for different types of sports but soccer was the main sport we had in mind when writing code.

*The end result would be a table such as one you could see on sports site 
(Fixtures table: http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/table)


*When determining a team's points, a victory nets you 3 points, a draw rewards both teams
with 1 points each, and a loss gives no points at all.
